                        <p>So far, we have built only a single page for our Bootstrap website. However, you might remember that, when setting up the navigation menu, we included several menu items. Yet, currently, these links don’t lead anywhere when you click them.</p>
                        <p>If you want to change that and add additional pages to your Bootstrap website, there’s nothing easier than that. The most straightforward way is to simply go to make a copy of index.html and give it a different name, typically that of the other page you want to create</p>
